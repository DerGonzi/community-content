## Introduction

In this tutorial is about the installation and the initial configuration of a MariaDB server.

**Prerequisites**

- A [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) account
- A Hetzner Cloud project for your Ubuntu Server
- A Hetzner Cloud Ubuntu Server

## Step 1 - Updating the server (Optional)

`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`

## Step 1.1 - Install the MySQL-server Package

`sudo apt install mysql-server`

```Shell
Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y
```

Choose **Y**.

### Step 2 - Run the installer

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

```Shell
Securing the MySQL server deployment.

Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.

VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No:
```

If you want to use the "VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT" type **Y** otherwise **N**, then press **enter**.

## Step 2.1 - Configure "VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT" (Optional)

```Shell
There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG:
```

In our tutorial we use MEDIUM so we choose **1**.

_Type **1**, then press **enter**_

## Step 3 - Set the password for the root user

```Shell
Please set the password for root here.

New password: mySecretPassword

Re-enter new password: mySecretPassword
```

Enter your password, press **enter** and re-enter your password, then again press **enter**.

_If you have set up the "VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT" press **y** now._

## Step 4 - Remove anonymous user (optional)

```Shell
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.
Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
```

_Type **Y**, then press **enter**_

## Step 5 - Configure root remote login

```Shell
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :
```

You have to choose this by yourself!
If you want to access remotely type **n** and press **enter** if not type **y** and press **enter**.

## Step 6 - Remove the test database

```Shell
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
```

_Type **Y**, then press **enter**_

```Shell
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.
```

# Step 7 - Reload privilege tables

```Shell
Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
```

_Type **Y**, then press **enter**_

```Shell
Success.

All done!
```

The installation and initial configuration are now complete!

## Conclusion

Now you can install and configure a MariaDB MySQL server.
